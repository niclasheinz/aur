# Automatation and Robotics

During 2 semesters in secondary school, I took the elective subject Automation and Robotics. During this time I was able to work with Arduinos. 

I was able to realise the following projects:
- Switch on flashing lights alternately 
- Controlling motors with remote control
- Current: Control Arduino with remote control & obstacle detection [(see here)](https://gitlab.com/niclasheinz/aur/-/tree/main/Projekte/Arduino-mit-Fernbedienung-steuern_Hinterniserkennung).
